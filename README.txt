description: Amiri font is an open font revival of the Arabic Naskh typeface
designed and first used by Bulaq Press in Cairo (Maṭbaʿtu Būlāq, also known as
Āl-Maṭbaʿtu Āl-Āmīriīaʰ) in the early twenty centuary.  Amiri's uniqueness
comes from its superb balance between the beauty of Naskh calligraphy and the
requirements of elegant typography.  Amiri is most suitable for running text
and book printing.
