Amiri Font

Amiri font is a Naskh style, typographically oriented font, mainly for
printing and running text.

Amiri font is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered by Bulaq
Press, also known as Amiria Press, hence the name.

The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between
the beauty of Naskh calligraphy on the one hand, and the constraints
and requirements of elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one
of the few metal typefaces that were used in typesetting the Koran (as
opposed to the usual handwritten calligraphy), making it a good source
for a typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.

Amiri Font Project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions
of Arabic typesetting (if partially), and adapting it to the era of
digital typesetting, in a publicly available form.

Amiri Font is a free, open source project that everyone is encouraged
to use and modify. See the license for more details.
